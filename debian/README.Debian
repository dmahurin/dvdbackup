dvdbackup for Debian
--------------------

This program does not itself burn dvd's - you'll need to use another program
such as dvdrecord for that.  dvdbackup also does not yet support splitting
a dvd9 image into two dvd5 images, although the author is working on it.  It 
also does not create all the parts of a valid DVD file system if they are not 
already present.  Extracting only one title set, for instance, will leave you
with VOB files only.  Programs like dvdauthor are the answer to this problem.

If you have access to dvd9's, or are burning an image that will fit on a
dvd5, the simplest way is:
dvdbackup -M -i/dvd -o /PATH/TO/BACKUP/ -nTITLE_OF_DVD
genisoimage -dvd-video -o ISONAME.iso /PATH/TO/BACKUP/
dvdrecord speed=1 -dao dev=0,0,0 ISONAME.iso

Happy burning!
