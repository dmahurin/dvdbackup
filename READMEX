dvdbackupx modification by Don Mahurin.

dvdbackupx-0.2 is based on dvdbackup-0.2

Description:

dvdbackupx is a version of dvdbackup modified to find unused blocks and
seek past them, potentially avoiding bad sectors. Unused blocks are found
by using the libdvdnav vm (called libdvdvm here, but not really an independent
library ) to simulate the execution of pre,post and cell commands to follow
each title in the title set.

The intended use of this is to avoid potentially bad sectors that are perhaps
created by disc manufacturers attempting to prevent consumer fair use or
otherwise subverting the "limited time" copyright condition of the US
constitution.

Usage:

dvdbackup -r u -M -i /dev/dvd -o /outdir

Notes:

Currently some vm instructions are detected ahead of time as breaking
instructions. Other instructions are skipped, as lead to program fault when
attempting to execute jump instructions (when opening the same or another
IFO). The jump detection is not ideal, as there may be some logic there
that could only be seen by a full vm.
The instruction detection could be avoided if libdvdvm could provided functions
that execute a command and end with a state that describes a jump, but does not
execute it.
