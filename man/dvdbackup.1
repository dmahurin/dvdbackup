.SH NAME
dvdbackup \- Tool to backup DVDs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dvdbackup
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B dvdbackup
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
\fBdvdbackup\fP is a tool to extract data from video DVDs.  It has the
advantages of being small, fast, and easy to use.
.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
print a brief usage message
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
print version information
.TP
.B \-I, \-\-info
for information about the DVD
.TP
.B \-M, \-\-mirror
backup the whole DVD
.TP
.B \-F, \-\-feature
backup the main feature of the DVD
.TP
.B \-T X, \-\-titleset=X
backup title set X
.TP
.B \-t X, \-\-title=X
backup title X
.TP
.B \-s X, \-\-start=X
backup from chapter X
.TP
.B \-e X, \-\-end=X
backup to chapter X
.TP
.B \-i DEVICE, \-\-input=DEVICE
where DEVICE is your DVD device.  This switch only needs to be used if your DVD
device node is not /dev/dvd
.TP
.B \-o DIRECTORY, \-\-output=DIRECTORY
where DIRECTORY is your backup target.  If not given, the current working
directory will be used.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
print more information about progress
.TP
.B \-n NAME, \-\-name=NAME
(optional) set the title \- useful if autodetection fails
.TP
.B \-a 0, \-\-aspect=0
to get aspect ratio 4:3 instead of 16:9 if both are present
.TP
.B  \-r {a,b,m}, \-\-error={a,b,m}
select read error handling:
a=abort,
b=skip block,
m=skip multiple blocks (default)
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-progress
print progress information while copying VOBs
.SH Option notes
.B \-a
is option to the
.B \-F
switch and has no effect on other options
.br
.B \-s
and
.B \-e
should preferably be used together with
.B \-t
.SH General backup information
If your backup directory is /my/dvd/backup/dir/ specified with the
.B \-o
flag, then dvdbackup will create a DVD\-Video structure under
/my/dvd/backup/dir/TITLE_NAME/VIDEO_TS.
If the
.B -o
flag is omitted, the current directory is used.

Since the title is "unique" you can use the same directory for all your DVD
backups. If it happens to have a generic title dvdbackup will exit with a return
value of 2, and you will need to specify a title name with the
.B \-n
switch.

dvdbackup will always mimic the original DVD\-Video structure. Hence if you e.g.
use the
.B \-M
(mirror) you will get an exact duplicate of the original. This means
that every file will have the same size as the original one. Likewise also for
the
.B \-F
and the
.B \-T
switch.

However the
.B \-t
and (\fB\-t \-s\fR/\fB\-e\fR)
switch is a bit different the titles sectors
will be written to the original file but not at the same offset as the original
one since there may be gaps in the cell structure that we do not fill.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.BI dvdbackup\ \-I
gathers information about the DVD.
/dev/dvd is the default device tried - you need
to use 
.B -i
if your device name is different.
.TP
.BI dvdbackup\ \-M
backups the whole DVD.
This action creates a valid DVD\-Video structure that can be burned to a
DVD\-/+R(W) with help of genisoimage.
.TP
.BI dvdbackup\ \-F
backups the main feature of the DVD.
This action creates a valid DVD\-Video structure of the feature title set.
Note that this will not result in an image immediately watchable - you will need
another program like dvdauthor to help construct the IFO files.

dvdbackup defaults to get the 16:9 version of the main feature if a 4:3 is also
present on the DVD.  To get the 4:3 version use
.B \-a
0.

dvdbackup makes it best to make a intelligent guess what is the main feature of
the DVD \- in case it fails please send a bug report.
.TP
.BI dvdbackup\ \-T \ 2
backups the title set
.I 2
i.e. all VTS_02_X.XXX files.
This action creates a valid DVD\-Video structure of the
specified title set.  Note that this will not result in an image immediately
watchable - you will need another program like dvdauthor to help construct the
IFO files.
.TP
.BI dvdbackup\ \-t \ 1
backups the title 1.
This action backups all cells that forms the specified title. Note that there
can be sector gaps in between one cell and another. dvdbackup will backup all
sectors that belongs to the title but will skip sectors that are not a part of
the title.
.TP
\fBdvdbackup \-t \fI1\fB \-s \fI20\fB \-e \fI25
This action will backup chapter 20 to 25 in title 1, as with the backup of a
title there can be sector gaps between one chapter (cell) and on other.
dvdbackup will backup all sectors that belongs to the title 1 chapter 20 to 25
but will skip sectors that are not a part of the title 1 chapter 20 to 25.

To backup a single chapter e.g. chapter 20 do
.B \-s
20
.B \-e
20.
.br
To backup from chapter 20 to the end chapter use only
.B \-s
20.
.br
To backup to chapter 20 from the first chapter use only
.B \-e
20.

You can skip the
.B \-t
switch and let the program guess the title although it is
not recommended.

If you specify a chapter that is higher than the last chapter of the title
dvdbackup will truncate to the highest chapter of the title.
